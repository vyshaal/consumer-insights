## Motivation
“Not being customer-centric is the biggest threat to any business”

Manufacturers and product designers are often interested in knowing how their product is doing in the market. 
Now-a-days there are various avenues where they can collect feedback from the end customers. These are one of the 
greatest data engineering problems to convert these large sets of data into valuable insights. From customer reviews 
not only we can understand whether a customer liked a product or not but also get specifics of what went wrong or what 
is it that they liked. This project will help in analyzing and solving some of these problems.

For example, a Product Manager at Bose Speakers would be interested in how their speakers are received in the market 
and what their customers are talking about the speakers.

* What do they like?
* What're they annoyed about?
* What do they expect?
* Did their expectations change over the time?

## Solution

A search platform for product makers to learn "Consumer Insights"

![Demo](http://g.recordit.co/97XX0cl3nG.gif)

In the demo, you can observe that while searching for "annoying" most of the people are complaining that the 
speaker is turning off automatically to save power.

## Data
[Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset](https://registry.opendata.aws/amazon-reviews/)
* 17 Years (1999-2015)
* 50 GB
* 9M+ Products
* 20M+ Users
* 130M+ Reviews


## Pipeline
![Consumer Insights](src/angular/src/assets/pipeline.png)
* Initially reviews are stored in an S3 Bucket 
* Spark loads a new batch of reviews after every one hour into memory
* Spark groups reviews by product, computes product analytics such as Product Rating, Total Number of Reviews, Reviews Breakdown 
and stores them in Elasticsearch
* After the arrival of every new batch, the spark job performs insert/update on the 
product depending on its existence in the database 
* Airflow schedules spark jobs to process an year of reviews every 1 hour
* Flask and Angular are used to develop the web application
